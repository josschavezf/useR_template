# xaringan template for useR presentations


Welcome to useR, in this repository you will find a template that shows the use of the  "useR" xaringan theme. 

I you have not intalled the xaringan package, run this command in your RStudio session:

```
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

Then, use the skeleton.Rmd file with the 'useR' and 'useR-fonts' theme to start writing your conference presentation.

Alternatively, use File > New file > Rmarkdown > From template > Ninja Presentation 
to start editing a new xaringan presentation.
